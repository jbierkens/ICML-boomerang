# ICML-boomerang / BoomerangDiffusionBridge

This code is based for a large extent upon code in the folder ZZDiffusionBridge from the Public directory  [SebaGraz/ZZDiffusionBridge](https://github.com/SebaGraz/ZZDiffusionBridge) (see pre-print [A piecewise deterministic Monte Carlo method for diffusion bridges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05889)). We build up from that implementation and add the Boomerang sampler for the problem of sampling diffusion bridges.

For reproducing Figure 3, the user should run the file `diffusion_simulation.jl` 
For reproducing Figure 4, the user should run the script `true_events_comparison.jl`
